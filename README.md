# How to connect your local machie to the GitHub and create your first reposit

## In this repository I will answer on questions:

- Where can you find the url to the repository?
- How to create a folder and file on the terminal?
- How to create your first repository in the GitHub?
- Where you can find and create your PAT(Personal access tokens)?
- And will show you the basic terminal commands.





## So, lets start!! 

1. First of all, we have to create a folder somewhere in your computer.
```
mkdir <file>
```
2. After that we have to initialize a [git](https://git-scm.com/).
```
git init
```
3. Here we have to create a repository or open the old one in GitHub. To create a new one just open a "+" in the !top right corner and choose "new Repository".

4. Now we have to connect our local machine and repository. For that we will use **git [remote](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)**.
```
git remote add <name> <url>
```
The url on our repository we can find on the first page of our repository called "code" just clicked on the green bold with the same named "code".

5.Now we have to [clone]( https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) repository to local machine(to get a [branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) "main"). 
```
git clone <url>
```
After that command you might be seing something like that:
```
Username for 'https://github.com':  enter your GitHub name
Password for 'https://Name@github.com': enter your PAT
```

PAT is a - Personal access token is one of the two ways supported by Space to authenticate and authorize API requests sent by external applications to Space to retreive and manipulate data.
- We can find it just opened **_Settings > developer Settings > Personal access tokens_** 
and generate a new token with turned on Â«write:packagesÂ» Â«delete:packagesÂ» and Â«delete_repoÂ»

* In case you see  `error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/YourName/repository.git'` , use this commands:
```
- git config --unset-all credential.helper
- git config --global --unset-all credential.helper
- git config --system --unset-all credential.helper
```
> That authentication errors can be coused by an old or incorrect username/password combination which remain stored in your local git configuration.

### Now our files are up to date and we can start working with it.
For example, we can create a file right here and [push](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push) it to the repository.
```
cd <repository> - the file we got after the clone command
git touch <file> - create a new file 
git add .    - add all changes to branch
git commit -m "message" - reate a point of branch, which we will push to repository
git push <remote> <branch>
```

### ðŸŽ‰Amazing, our repository is up to date and everything is working!ðŸŽ‰ Now you know how to connect a local machine with gitHub and how to work with it. And i believe,that after this tutorial it might be easier to understand the GitHub base and how it works.
